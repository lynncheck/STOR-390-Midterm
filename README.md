### Abstract

The midterm paper, Classifying Brain Waves: Seizure Prediction and the Ethical Challenges Ahead, will be observing the research study, _On the Time Series K-Nearest Neighbor Classification of Abnormal Brain Activity_. It will evaluate the data collecting methodology, possible bias from their chosen machine learning algorithm, and the ethical and moral concerns associated with the research. The research study collected continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten Epileptic patients. The data was randomly sampled to be used as the testing and training data set for the K-Nearest Neightbors (KNN) model. It aims to develop an algorithm capable of predicting seizures.
